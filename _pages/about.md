##### **Greetings!**

I'm **Mike Denisov**, a seasoned Software Developer with a strong foundation in game development and a comprehensive background in backend and web development. Utilizing **C#** and **.NET** as my primary technology stack, I also bring a versatile toolkit of secondary tools and languages gathered over 12 years.

I thrive on solving complex problems, breathing life into meaningful projects, and creating engaging interactive applications. Whether troubleshooting intricate issues or architecting innovative solutions, I bring a passion for overcoming challenges.

##### **Game Development (8+ Years)**

In my over 8 years of the gamedev journey, **Unity** has been my primary tool, complemented by experience with other game engines as well. My expertise spans the entire game development lifecycle - Iâ€™ve led teams, developed frameworks, built AI systems, architected backends for a mobile MMO game, and worked in a multimillion DAU **SaaS** environment, including the production side of a project.

##### **Backend and Web Development (4+ Years)**

Before venturing into GameDev, I accumulated over 4 years of professional experience in web and backend development, with a focus on the **.NET** technology stack. I emphasize this not as an extra point but to highlight the ongoing relevance of this skill set. I've contributed to complex large-scale B2B systems, developed SPA pages, and engineered specialized microservices.

##### **Inspiration**

Participating in industry events, hackathons, and game jams is a great way for me to jump into new shoes and expand my horizon. Exploring cutting-edge technology is not just a task - it's a perpetual source of inspiration that fuels my work in every project, where creativity meets functionality to deliver exceptional results.
