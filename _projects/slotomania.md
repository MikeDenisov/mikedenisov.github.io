### Challenges
* Extremely high quality bar - when project have millions daily users, even very improbable corner cases bubble up quite fast.
* 'Must release until date' requirements of the seasonal feature.
* Large legacy codbase that couldn't be rebuilt and must stay in the project - sets of legacy unique content and features that players collected and must be held in the project, with continious development of related functionality.
* Releases support on over distribution 9 platforms.
* Enormous size of the codebase.
* Deeply multithreaded environment.
