### Role
As a **Technical Lead** at **Playtika**, I led the client development of two teams and made significant contributions to both project features and infrastructure. I played a pivotal role in resolving numerous complex production issues. My primary focus was on the collectibles aspect of the game, comprising tens of feature modules and services. These components were part of continuous development, with seasonal releases introducing unique features while preserving the state of previous releases.

### Challenges
* Maintaining an extremely high quality bar, crucial for a project with millions of daily users where even improbable corner cases surface rapidly.
* Meeting 'must release until date' requirements for seasonal features.
* Managing enormous size of the codebase, necessitating continuous development of related functionality.
* Supporting releases on over 9 distribution platforms.
* Operating in a complex distributed and multithreaded development environment.
