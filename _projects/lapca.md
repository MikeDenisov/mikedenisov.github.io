### Overview
L.A.P.C.A. (Mechanical Unfoldable Robotic Hand) represents a collaborative effort within a team of friends. This prototype, designed for the [NASA Space App Challenge](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org) hackathon, features a front-end camera and serves a crucial role in periodically capturing images of designated areas. The primary objective is to detect visual changes and identify potential damages to the spacecraft skin.
