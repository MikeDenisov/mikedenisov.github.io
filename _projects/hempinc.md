### Role
In my role as a **Senior Unity Developer** in the Game Development Division of **Room 8 Studio**, I was involved in various game mechanics, UI, and infrastructure modules. My primary contribution to this game was in AI development. I created a behavior-tree based AI framework, implemented numerous character behaviors, and designed a custom pathfinding system. This system enabled motion planning with collision avoidance between characters without the involvement of a physics engine.
