### Role
I had a role of **Senior Unity Developer** in Game Development Devision of **Room 8 Studio** and I've put my hands on a various game mechanics, UI and infrastructure modules. 

But my primary contribution in this game was AI - I've developer a behaviour-tree based AI framework, along with lots of character behaviours and a custom pathfinding system, that enabled motion planning with collision avoidance between characters without involvement of physics engine.

### Challenges
* Advanced animations system with lots of customizations, attachements, etc.
* High requirements for optimization due to packed with features functionality and low-end target mobile devices.
* Required number of custom advanced editors for AI behaviours customization and navigation markup.
* Multiple complex AI behaviours like staying in queues, dragging items, etc.
* Custom mobile platforms plugins to implement in-game live streaming radio.
* Custom pathfinding solution (Hierarchical) to allow spreaded pathing and optimized collision avoiding.
* Quite complicated UI decisions.
